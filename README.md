# Titanic

(Ongoing)
From Kaggle's Titanic competition- this project aims to predict who survives the Titanic based on qualities such as age, sex, class, title, etc. in the training data. Multiple attempts will be made in order to find a method that will accurately predict the test data by using machine learning tools.
